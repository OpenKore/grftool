**** Version 1.2.0

- Sprite preview support in the Linux/GTK frontend.
- Some bug fixes in the Win32 frontend. This probably solves the
  error messages that some people get while extracting files.
- Improved GRF file adding support in libgrf.
- Added a pkg-config entry for Linux, so applications can easily
  use libgrf.
- A Software Development Kit (SDK) for Win32 is now available,
  making it easier for Win32 software developers to use libgrf.
