Well, over the past couple of days I've been analizing the gat files, and I
feel confident that I understand them now.

First of all, gat files are used to store information on the height of tiles
and if you can walk on them or not.

The structure is as follows:
<'GRAT' heading>.4B
<513 Heading>.W
<Width of the map>.L
<Height of the map>.L
{
	Square data:
	<height of upper left corner>.L
	<height of upper right corner>.L
	<height of lower left corner>.L
	<height of lower right corner>.L
}.20B


Explanation:
The first six bytes is the header of the file, it contains the word GRAT and
then the number 513 (type: word/short) (01 02 in hex)

Then next eight bytes contain the size information for the map. The first four
bytes (type: long) are for the width (or x size). The second four bytes
(type: long) are for the height (or y sizez)

The rest of the file is the information for each block (20 bytes each). In each
block there is four height numbers (type: floating point). The first height number
is the height of the upper left corner of the block. The second number is the height
of the upper right corner of the block. The third number is the height of the lower
left corner of the block, and the fourth number is the lower right corner of the block.
the last number (type: long) is the type of block. I don't know what every type is for,
but 0 is blocking tiles, and 1 are non-blocking tiles, 5 seems to be 'weird' blocking tiles.

Something else interesting about gat files. When the client loads them it does a
vertical flip on them (making 0,0 be in the lower left corner instead of the upper left).

Well that pretty much covers it. If you have any more questions you welcome to post them here.
